## About
This small app allows you to navigate to locations on the Waze live map with a human readable string.  
You can use this utility in apps like [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) to open a Waze route with text search, which is normally not possible.

## Usage
1. Register for the free plan on [positionstack](https://positionstack.com/).
2. Take note of the API key issued by positionstack.
3. Use Waze Live Map Relay as follows:
```
https://waze-live-map-relay.herokuapp.com?to=Amsterdam&key={API_KEY}
```
